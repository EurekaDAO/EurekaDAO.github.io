My name is Brian Pistone and today I am announcing the launch of Eureka DAO! Some of you fellow nerds may recall a show on the Sci-Fi channel called “Eureka”, about a town full of super-genius scientists set loose with unlimited funding. I’ve named the DAO in honor of that vision and hope we can create a community that allows developers to freely innovate the generation of technological breakthroughs.Eureka DAO’s primary focus will be to create open software that allows businesses to regain ownership of their data, to this end we are planning a suite of small business and enterprise software products aimed at replacing various cloud services from centralized providers like AWS, Azure, Google, Datto, Kaseya, Zendesk, and others.** Please note that we do not think there is anything fundamentally wrong with the majority of these providers, and until decentralized on-chain alternatives have been developed we will be utilizing some of these providers. **Initial Project Roadmap AuthFlow AuthFlow is an Identity &amp; Authentication Management (IAM) system secured by the Flow Blockchain Planned Server SDKs Go NodeJS PHP Planned Client SDKs JS Swift Business Citadel Business Citadel is a multi-purpose multi-sig platform allowing businesses to create their Web3 presence, store business funds and information, as well as provide an identity management solution for employees based on AuthFlow. This first version of the software will not support other Fungible or NonFungible tokens while we explore the necessary KYC/KYB requirements. Business Citadel aims to be a one-stop-shop for businesses to manage their employees and eventually provide a system for businesses to interact with each other both in person and within Web3 applications. Name TBD: IT Services PSA (Professional Services Automation/Ticketing &amp; Project System) We plan to create a PSA service similiar to Datto PSA and Kaseya BMS but with out all the control of VC funds, 3 years contracts, and zero ownership of your data. More information to come soon! Check back soon for more information about the DAO, how to get involved, and our release timeline." } ]
